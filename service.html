    <h1>Prospects</h1>
    <h2>
      I have a strong desire to be a proactive force within my community, striving to uplift those in need and create meaningful change in the world. 
      I want to be someone who is very active in my community. All of this is possible through the lens of engineering, specifically computer engineering.
      In the future, I hope to create something that is specifically designed with sustainability in mind, and genuinely makes a positive impact in society.
      An example of this would be the lightbulb. Without an invention like this, our world would be entirely different. I want to create something that is
      just as impactful as the lightbulb, and I believe that I can do this through computer engineering.
